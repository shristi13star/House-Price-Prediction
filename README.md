# 🏠 House Price Prediction Regression Project

This project builds a regression model to predict housing prices based on various features from a structured dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and model training using Python.

### 🎯 Goal

To train a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices based on given property features.

### 🧰 Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` *(assuming based on standard ML workflow)*

---

### 📁 Dataset

- `train.csv`: Training dataset with feature columns and target (house prices)
- `test.csv`: Test dataset for predictions
- Dataset is loaded using Pandas and explored through visualization libraries.

---

### 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Importing Libraries**  
2. **Loading Datasets**  
   - `train.csv` and `test.csv` using Pandas  
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling null values  
   - Feature encoding  
   - Outlier detection  
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
5. **Model Training**  
   - Regression techniques (Linear, Random Forest, etc.)  
6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Using metrics like R² Score, MAE, MSE  
7. **Predictions on Test Data**

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the notebook:
   - Open `House_Prediction1.ipynb` in Jupyter or VSCode
   - Execute all cells in sequence

---

### 📌 Output

Final predictions are generated on the `test.csv` dataset after training on `train.csv`.
